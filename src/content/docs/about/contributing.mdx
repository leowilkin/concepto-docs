# Contributing

We welcome contributions of any size and contributors of any skill level.
As an open source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors.
We are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

:::note[Tip for new contributors]
Take a look at [GitHub's Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) for helpful information on working with GitHub.

## Types of contributions

There are lots of ways to contribute to Concepto AI.

Help writing docs, catching typos and errors, as well as translating docs into other languages is always welcome.

You can also get involved by leaving feedback on [issues](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/issues) or reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/pulls) by other contributors.

We encourage you to:

- [**Open an issue**](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/issues/new) to let us know of bugs in Concepto, documentation you found unclear, or other issues you run into.

- [**Look at existing issues**](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/issues).

- **Make a pull request (PR)** to address an open issue or to fix obvious problems.
  Read more about [making a PR in GitHub’s docs][pr-docs]

- [**Review existing PRs**](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/pulls) to help us merge contributions sooner.

- [**Add or update translations**](#translations). We need help translating both Concepto’s UI and documentation.

### Setting up a development environment

You can [develop locally](#developing-locally) or use an online coding development environment like [GitHub Codespaces](#developing-using-github-codespaces) to get started quickly.

#### Developing locally

**Prerequisites:** Developing Concepto AI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v16 or higher) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/). Make sure you have these installed before following these steps. If you're developing new AI tools, you may need an OpenAI Developer API Key.

1. **Fork Concepto or the Concepto Docs** to your personal GitHub account by clicking <kbd>Fork</kbd> on the project of your choosing.
  <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Concepto">
        [Concepto AI](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto)
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Concepto Docs">
        [Concepto Docs](https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto-docs)
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. **Clone your fork** of Concepto to your computer. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` in the command below with your GitHub username to clone in a Terminal:
  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Concepto">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/concepto.git
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Concepto Docs">
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/concepto-docs.git
        ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

3. **Change directory** to the cloned repo:
   
   <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Concepto">
        ```sh
        cd concepto
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Concepto Docs">
        ```sh
        cd concepto-docs
        ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

4. **Install dependencies** with `npm`:

     ```sh
     npm i
     ```

#### Developing using GitHub Codespaces

**Create a new codespace** via

  <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Concepto">
        [Create new Concepto Codespace](https://codespaces.new/leowilkin/concepto)
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Concepto Docs">
        [Create new Concepto Docs Codespace](https://codespaces.new/leowilkin/concepto-docs)
      </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

The dev container used for GitHub Codespaces can also be used with [other supporting tools](https://containers.dev/supporting), including VS Code.


## Testing

### Testing visual changes while you work

Run the dev server on the docs site to see how changes you make impact a project using Concepto.

To do this, open up your terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and then run `pnpm dev`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should then be able to open `<http://localhost:4321>` or `<http://localhost:3000>` and see your changes.

## Translations

Translations help make Concepto Docs accessible to more people.

### Translating Concepto AI's UI

Concepto’s UI comes with some built-in text elements. For example, the `Concepto it`, which needs translating.

### Translating Cin’s docs

Concepto AI’s documentation is also translated into multiple languages. You can find the source code for the site in the `src` folder of this repository.

Help out by:

- Reviewing [open translation PRs]((https://github.com/leowilkin/concepto/pulls)
- Updating out-of-date translated pages
- Adding an untranslated page

#### Adding a new language to Concepto’s docs

To add a language, you will need its BCP-47 tag and a label. See [“Adding a new language”](https://github.com/withastro/docs/blob/main/contributor-guides/translating-astro-docs.md#adding-a-new-language) in the Astro docs repo for some helpful tips around choosing these.

- Add your language to the `locales` config in `docs/astro.config.mjs`
- Create the first translated page for your language.  
   This must be the Concepto landing page: `docs/src/content/docs/{language}/index.mdx`.
- Open a pull request on GitHub to add your changes to Concepto Docs!
