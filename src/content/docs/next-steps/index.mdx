Well done! You've made your website concept with Concepto AI. Now what? Let's view ans edit it locally first, and then we'll look at publishing it to the web!

## Develop Locally

1. Copy your code from your generation to your clipboard.
:::tip[WIP]
Coming Soon: Copy code button on generation modal

2. Open up your choice of IDE (dev software). We like VS Code.
If you don't have an IDE, Notepad or similar will do.
3. Make a new folder and add a new file named `index.html`
4. Paste your code into here
5. Find your file in File Explorer/Finder and right click it
6. Choose open in Chrome/Safari/Edge
(edge is unsupported and cursed, jk)
7. Edit your code from the IDE, save and refresh the browser.
