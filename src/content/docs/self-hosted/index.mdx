**Self Hosted** is a great option if you want to have full control over your deployment. You can change the code as you wish, and you can use your own domain.

:::caution[Note]
You must have a **server** & **OpenAI Tier 2** to host Concepto AI. If you don't have one, we recommend using the Cloud Hosted version.
